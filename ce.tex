In this chapter we define our \ce machine semantics, both big-step and
small-step versions. We try and give some intuition for why it works, and show
an example derivation for the small step semantics. The definitions here are the
core of both implementations, the native code compiler in Chapter~\ref{chap:cem}
and the verified compiler in Chapter~\ref{chap:verified}.
