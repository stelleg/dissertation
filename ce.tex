This chapter defines the \ce machine semantics, both big-step and small-step
versions. It attempts to convey some intuition for why the shared environment
structure works as a technique for sharing results of computation. The
definitions here are the core of both implementations, the native code compiler
in Chapter~\ref{chap:cem} and the verified compiler in
Chapter~\ref{chap:verified}. More specifically, it formalize the connection
between call-by-need evaluation and shared environments in a big-step semantics
(Section~\ref{sec:calc}).  Section~\ref{sec:mach} implements the big-step with a
small-step semantics by adding a context (or stack). The proof that it is a
correct implementation is left for Chapter~\ref{chap:verified}.
