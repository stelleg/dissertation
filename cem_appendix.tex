In this appendix we discuss details of the native code compiler. We focus on
implementation details not included in Chapter~\ref{chap:cem}. This includes a
complete definition of the language, as well as extensive examples of what
writing programs in the language looks like. In part, we share these details due
to a number of interesting properties that the implementation has. Some of those
properties include

\begin{itemize}
\item No first class recursion and let bindings. Replaced by use of Y combinator
\item No algebraic data types: Scott encoded data types. 
\item World type: reasoning about IO in an untyped setting by passing world
values.
\item No libc dependence: system calls as an explicit language construct
\item Novel syntax: explicit parentheses, a merging of lambda calculus and lisp
\end{itemize}

\section{Source Language}

For a better grasp on what the \ce native code compiler can do, this section
defines the syntax and core language, and provides a number of example programs
and libraries. It highlights the fact that the compiler can handle machine
literals and primitive operations, including system calls and a basic system for
monadic side effects.  

One way to view this section is as the results of an experiment in how simple we
can make a call-by-need source language, and still have the ability to write
real programs. 

\subsection{Language Definition}

Here we give the full language definition: 

\begin{verbatim}
data Expr a b = Var b
              | App (Expr a b) (Expr a b)
              | Lam a (Expr a b)
              | Lit Literal
              | Op Op
              | World

type Literal = Int

data Op = Add 
        | Sub 
        | Mul 
        | Div 
        | Mod 
        | Eq 
        | Neq 
        | Lt 
        | Gt 
        | Le 
        | Ge 
        | Write WordSize 
        | Read WordSize 
        | Call String Int 
        | Syscall Int
\end{verbatim}

The expressions include the three standard lambda calculus constructors, as well
as literals \texttt{Lit}, which are standard 32 bit machine words, machine
operations \texttt{Op}, and world values \texttt{World}, which are used for
reasoning about IO. 

\subsection{Syntax}

The source syntax for the compiler is also, to the best of my knowledge, unique.
There are a number of non-standard design decisions worth mentioning. The first,
and most significant one, is a non-standard use of parentheses. Instead of
implicit applications, we use \texttt{()} parentheses to explicitly denote
left-associative applications, and \texttt{[]} brackets to denote explicit
right-associative applications. We use either the unicode character for lambda
\texttt{λx.b} the forward slash \texttt{\textbackslash x.b} to denote lambdas,
where \texttt{x} is a variable and \texttt{b} is the body of the lambda. This
choice of explicit applications simplifies the syntax in a way that prevents
ambiguity and simplifies parsing.  It is effectively standard notation but with
explicit parenthesis, like Lisp, making it easier to parse. In addition, we add
syntax for let bindings in the form of curly braces. Read left curly braces
\texttt{\{} as \texttt{let} and right curly brace \texttt{\}} as \texttt{in}.
The reason for this was to avoid any keywords in the language, and therefore we
require no tokenizer. Finally, we support string and character literals in the
standard way. Following Haskell, we also define a global binding scope,
implementing the following structure (with the default compilation options): 
\begin{verbatim}
{
<preludes>
<program source>
} (main Ω λv.λw.w) 
\end{verbatim}
This approach allows us to write programs, much like Haskell, with global
bindings, including a requirement to bind the variable \texttt{main} as our
outermost function. From a typed perspective, this results in an expression of
type World, assuming the input of \texttt{Ω} (the input world value). The syntax
is easy enough to parse that it's worth sharing the parser source directly as a
kind of formal grammar: 

\begin{verbatim}
lc :: Parser SExpr
lc =  Lam <$> ((char '\\' <|> char 'λ') *> word <* char '.') <^> lc
  <|> Lit <$> literal
  <|> Op  <$> op
  <|> Var <$> word
  <|> World <$ char 'Ω'
  <|> char '(' ^> (foldl1 App <$> many1 (notCode *> lc <* notCode)) <^ 
      char ')'
  <|> char '[' ^> (foldr1 App <$> many1 (notCode *> lc <* notCode)) <^ 
      char ']'
  <|> char '\'' *> charLit <* char '\''
  <|> char '\"' 
      *> (foldr (\h t -> App (App cons h) t) nil <$> many charLit) <* 
      char '\"'
  <|> char '{' ^> 
      (lets <$> many (notCode *> binding <* notCode) <^> 
      (char '}' ^> lc))
      where lets = flip $ foldr ($)
            binding = mylet <$> word <^> (char '=' ^> lc)
            mylet var term body = App (Lam var body) term
\end{verbatim}

Note that due to our avoidance of tokenization, we directly parse any
non-numeral, parentheses, or white space string into a variable.

\subsection{Prelude}
An extremely useful tool for any language is a base set of functionality
available in global namespace. I follow Haskell terminology and refer to this
set of bound variables as a Prelude. 

I start with a pure fragment of the prelude: there are no partial functions
modulo termination and type-safety. Note we have wrapper functions for our
machine primitive operations that force evaluation of arguments. We also make
heavy use of right-associative applications, wrapped with square brackets
\texttt{[]}. By using this right associative operator, along with the
implementation of literals, applying themselves to a continuation, we attain a
method of forcing evaluation before applying a primitive operation. This is in
contrast to using an infix operator, e.g. the $\$$ operator in Haskell. Note the
\texttt{\_} prefix for primitive operations. 

Also note that we define the y-combinator at the start of the prelude; this is
the source of all recursion. Whether or not this is sufficient for all
call-by-need recursion seems to be a topic for disagreement, but we have chosen,
wherever feasible, to remove constructs from the core language when an
equivalent semantics can be achieved without it.

\subsection{Side Effects and Partial Functions}
A necessary feature of a real world programming language is the ability to have
side effects. Here we define a small set of basic tools for implementing basic
side effects, including memory reads and writes, and system calls. Note we take
an approach that avoids depending on \texttt{libc}, implementing analogous
functionality directly in lambda calculus with access to system calls. 

For modeling side effects in lambda calculus, we take an approach inspired by
the IO monad in Haskell. We extend our language with an object of type real
world, and have our side-effectful functions consume and generate a new
real-world value. This allows us to implement and use the monad bind and return
functions directly. While we don't have infix operators or Haskell's
do-notation, writing imperative programs is still entirely possible, though
certainly more clunky, much like Wadler's early work with
monads~\cite{wadlermonad} but without infix operators.

system = (compose fork exec)
\end{verbatim}

Note the use of parentheses gets pretty hairy. Despite our right associative
applications, the lack of infix operators and do-notation hurts the readability
of long imperative programs significantly. Still, it is certainly
\emph{possible} to write programs in this style. Note also that our heavy use of
newPage shows that our lack of stack allocated memory is a pain. Due to our use
of the system stack for our argument closures and update markers, incorporating
alloca-style stack allocations would be a significant challenge, though it
should be possible. 

\subsection{Example Programs}

In addition to re-writing the no-fib benchmark suite, we started writing example
programs in this source language to gauge the difficulty. These programs use the
prelude described above to implement basic programs. 

We start with a canonical example of using call-by-need to implement a
dynamic programming linear time Fibonacci. 

\begin{verbatim}
fibs = (Y \fibs.[(1 :) (1 :) (zipWith + fibs (tail fibs))])
\end{verbatim}

This is an interesting example, because unlike the similar Haskell
implementation, this implementation is \emph{guaranteed} to run in linear time.
Because Haskell is a \emph{non-strict} language, we rely on its use of
call-by-need as an optimization technique, not a guaranteed property of the
language. Note also the infix use of \texttt{:}. This is possible due to the
implementation of machine integers. Recall that we don't have algebraic data
types, so the technique used by Haskell of wrapping machine literals in a
\texttt{newtype} is not an option. Instead, we use evaluation to force the
value. In place of an environment pointer, we place the machine literal, and use
the code pointer to take the continuation and apply itself to it. In this case,
that results in the cons constructor applying itself to the value 1. Note that
this is the approach used in all the machine primitive operations in the prelude
listed above as well. While this is operationally equivalent the Haskell
approach, it does raise questions about referential transparency.    

Another simple example shows how we can use the fork system call to implement
parallel programs. This shows how easy it is to use the IO monad without the use
of type classes. 

\begin{verbatim}
main = (>>= sys_fork \r.(r = 0
  (print "Child says hi")
  (print "Parent says hi")))
\end{verbatim}

Note again we use the fact that forcing \texttt{r} before checking equality is a
perfectly valid thing to do, though not necessary in this case as the equality
check \texttt{=} will force it as well. 

\section{Visualization}

In addition to the native code compiler, I have implemented a graphviz-based
visualization tool that helps visualize how the heap changes over time. It uses
variable names in the heap instead of deBruijn indices to increase readability.
It also shows the stack and current closure through steps of the small step \ce
semantics. The primary use is just to see how the cactus structure evolves
through evaluation, and how it ensures sharing. 

For example, consider evaluation of the expression

\begin{verbatim}
(\a.(\b.(b a) \c.(c a)) (\i.i \j.j))
\end{verbatim}

By running the \texttt{cem} executable with the flags \texttt{-pg}, we get the
following output: 
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/1.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/2.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/3.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/4.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/5.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/6.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/7.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/8.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/9.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/10.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/11.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/12.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/13.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/14.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/15.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/16.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/17.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/18.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/19.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/20.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/21.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/22.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth/2]{figures/23.pdf}

We can see that through the evaluation, the variable \texttt{a} is dereferenced
twice, in two different scopes. The cactus structure ensures that the value is
correctly shared between the two instances, with the second dereference
correctly dereferencing the evaluated identity function. 

\subsection{Benchmarks}
To convince the reader that the benchmarks are equivalent to the Haskell
variants described in~\ref{sec:eval}, we share the source code of some of them
here, along side their Haskell counterparts.

First, we start with the primes example. In the our language, the implementation
looks as follows.

\begin{verbatim}
divs = \n.\x.(x % n != 0)
thefilter = \l.(filter [divs head l] (tail l))
primes = [(map head) (iterate thefilter) from 2]

main = (>>= getArgs \args.(args (error "usage: primes <n>") \n.\t.
       (printf "%d" (!! (readInt n) primes))))
\end{verbatim}

The Haskell version is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
import System.Environment

suCC :: Int -> Int
suCC x = x + 1

isdivs :: Int  -> Int -> Bool
isdivs n x = mod x n /= 0

the_filter :: [Int] -> [Int]
the_filter (n:ns) = filter (isdivs n) ns

primes :: [Int]
primes = map head (iterate the_filter (iterate suCC 2))

main = do
	[arg] <- getArgs
	print $ primes !! (read arg)
\end{verbatim}

Note that we use the helper function \texttt{from} from the prelude which uses
the partially applied \texttt{+ 1} directly, but otherwise the implementations
are identical. This is characteristic of how each of the benchmarks differ in
our version compared to the Haskell version. Both the Haskell and our versions
can be found in the source tarball.
