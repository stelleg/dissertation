In this chapter I define the \ce machine semantics, both big-step and small-step
versions. I try and convey some intuition for why the shared environment
structure works as a technique for sharing results of computation. The
definitions here are the core of both implementations, the native code compiler
in Chapter~\ref{chap:cem} and the verified compiler in
Chapter~\ref{chap:verified}.

Specifically, we formalize the connection between call-by-need evaluation and
shared environments in a big-step semanitcs (Section~\ref{sec:calc}).
Section~\ref{sec:mach} implements the big-step with a small-step semantics by
adding a context (or stack). We leave the proof that it is a correct
implementation for Chapter~\ref{chap:verified}.
