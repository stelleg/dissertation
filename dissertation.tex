  This dissertation is the culmination of work over a period covering most of my
  adult life. Because of this, the list of people who deserve credit for it is
  far too long to list here. Instead, I'll make a meager attempt at listing a
  few who played particularly important roles. 

  Starting at the beginning, I'd like to thank my parents and brothers, who gave
  me a childhood rich in love and fun. In a sense, my decision to pursue a PhD
  was driven by a need to continue having fun doing what I love.  

  Most of the fun I've had has not been sitting and thinking about hard
  problems, but making lifelong friends along the way. To Taylor, Drew, Ben,
  Eric, George, Vu, and others, thank you for the technical discussions, the
  parties, the games, the hikes, the road trips, and most of all your
  friendship. Also, thanks to my three amigos for life, Drake, Mike, and Larkin,
  for the much-needed breaks from work. 

  I thank my PhD advisor, Darko Stefanovic, for his support and advice through
  my unconventional final years through the program. Without his help and
  wisdom there is no question that this dissertation would not exist. Stephanie
  Forrest deserves a great deal of credit as well, both for bringing me into the
  department, and supporting and advising me selflessly through the challenging
  task of finding a topic I love. Finally, I would not be here in New Mexico at
  all without the mentorship of my friend Eric Vatikiotis-Bateson.

  The papers that form this basis of this dissertation would not have been
  possible without the help of my extraordinary co-authors, Darko Stefanovic,
  Stephen Olivier, and Stephanie Forrest. Their ability to write clearly and
  carefully continues to inspire me to be a better communicator. My co-authors,
  Kei Davis, and Patrick Bridges all have my thanks for their role on my
  committee.

  I thank my wonderful wife, Beth, for truly being my life partner and always
  inspiring me to be a better person. And to my children, Adelaide and Sullivan,
  thank you for making life so much more.

\begin{abstract}
Call-by-need semantics implement the wisdom that work should be done at most
once. It is the default semantics for the popular programming language Haskell,
and is largely responsible for Haskell's success in its ability to create
high-level, composable, easy to reason about abstractions with good performance.
Unfortunately, while correctness of Haskell code is famously easy to reason
about, the correctness of the de-facto standard Haskell compiler, GHC, is not.
This prevents programmers from knowing their reasoning about Haskell is
preserved through compilation. This thesis presents a new way to compile
call-by-need semantics using shared environments that doesn't have this issue.
The thesis is broken into two parts. First, we show that the abstract machine,
the \ce machine, can be implemented as a native code compiler that has good
performance. Second, we present a verified compiler, implemented in the Coq
proof assistant, demonstrating how the simplicity of the approach enables formal
verification.
