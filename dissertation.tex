  This dissertation is the culmination of work over a period covering most of my
  adult life. Because of this, the list of people who deserve credit for it is
  far too long to list here. Instead, I'll make a meager attempt at listing a
  few who played particularly important roles. 

  Starting at the beginning, I'd like to thank my parents and brothers, who gave
  me a childhood rich in love and fun. In a sense, my decision to pursue a PhD
  was driven by a need to continue having fun doing what I love.  

  Surprisingly, most of the fun I've had has not been sitting and thinking about
  hard problems, but making irreplaceable lifelong friends along the way. To
  Taylor, Ben, Eric, Drew, George, Vu, and others, thank you for the brutally
  honest technical discussions, the parties, the games, the hikes, the road
  trips, and most of all your friendship. And of course, thanks to my three
  amigos for life, Drake, Mike, and Larkin. 

  It would be remiss of me to not thank my advisor, Darko Stefanovic, for his
  support and advice through my unconventional final years through the program.
  Without his help and wisdom there is no question that this dissertation would
  not exist. Stephanie Forrest deserves a great deal of credit as well, both for
  bringing me into the department, and supporting and advising me selflessly
  through the challenging task of finding a topic I love. Finally, I would not
  be here in New Mexico at all without the help and mentorship of my true friend
  Eric Vatikiotis-Bateson.

  The papers that form this basis of this dissertation would not have been
  possible without the help of my extraordinary co-authors, Darko Stefanovic,
  Stephen Olivier, and Stephanie Forrest. Their ability to write clearly and
  carefully continues to inspire me to be a better communicator. 

  Finally, I thank my wonderful wife, Beth, for truly being my life partner and
  always inspiring me to be a better human. And to my children, Adelaide and
  Sullivan, thank you for making life so much more.

\begin{abstract}
Call-by-need semantics implement the wisdom that work should be done at most
once. It is the basis of the popular programming language Haskell, and is often
credited with Haskell's success in its ability to create high-level, composable,
easy to reason about abstractions with good performance. Unfortunately, while
correctness of Haskell code is famously easy to reason about, the correctness of
the de-facto standard Haskell compiler, GHC, is not. This prevents programmers
from knowing their formal reasoning about Haskell is preserved through
compilation. This thesis presents a new way to compile call-by-need semantics,
that doesn't have this issue. The thesis is broken into two parts. First, we
show that the abstract machine can be implemented as a native code compiler that
has good performance. This compiler extends lambda calculus with literals,
primitive operations, and side effects. Second, we present a verified compiler
in Coq, showing how the simplicity of the abstract machine enables formal
verification.
